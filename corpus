Carrera says she has known since she was in kindergarten. She went to a Catholic school and had a crush on a fellow classmate, Anthony; she would get in trouble for running up to him and kissing him on the cheek every day.
"I knew that it wasn't me, as a boy having a crush on a boy. It was me, wanting to be a pretty girl, having a crush on a boy," she says. After a parent-teacher conference, she was transferred to a public school and put two and two together: She shouldn't express her femininity outside the home.
"My parents, thank God, never forced me to act any other kind of way but myself, so I was really lucky," she says. "But when I was in school or outside the house, it was always an act, it was always a cover-up -- and I grew up with a lot of frustration."
At 18, she got her first car and left some of that frustration in the rearview mirror. She drove to New York and became immersed in the drag club scene, where she began to "live freely and happily."
Then came "Drag Race." Since appearing on the show, Carrera has gained more than 66,000 followers on Twitter, 90,000 on Instagram and 215,000 on Facebook.
Carrera became a part of the mainstream media conversation when she received more than 46,000 signatures on a Change.org petition to become Victoria's Secret's first transgender "angel." The petition gained a significant amount of traction only a few days before the 2013 fashion show was set to tape in November, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. (The company has not responded to the petition.)
